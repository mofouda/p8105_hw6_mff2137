## Problem 2

### Data cleaning and tidying

``` r
homicide <-
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
      city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
      case = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
      victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
      victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White", "Black"))%>% 
    filter(
        !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")),
        victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

missing_plot <-
    homicide %>% 
    Amelia::missmap()
```

### Fitting the model

``` r
balt_df <-
    homicide %>% 
    filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 

balt_model <-
    balt_df %>% 
    glm(case ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = .) %>% 
    broom::tidy()

balt_or <- 
    glm(case ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = balt_df) %>% 
    epiDisplay::logistic.display(simplified = TRUE) %>% 
    knitr::kable(digits = 2)

balt_or
```

\|\| \|\| \|\| \|\|

|                  |   OR | lower95ci | upper95ci | Pr(\>\|Z\|) |
|:-----------------|-----:|----------:|----------:|------------:|
| victim_age       | 0.99 |      0.99 |      1.00 |        0.04 |
| victim_sexMale   | 0.43 |      0.32 |      0.56 |        0.00 |
| victim_raceBlack | 0.43 |      0.31 |      0.61 |        0.00 |

\|\| \|\| \|\| \|\|

The odds ratio of for solving homicides comparing male victims to female
victims keeping all other variables fixed in Baltimore, MD is 0.43 and
the 95% confidence interval is 0.32 and 0.56.

## Regression across all cities

``` r
all_cities_model <-
    homicide %>% 
    nest(df = -city_state) %>% 
    mutate(
        models = map(.x = df, ~glm(case ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = .x)),
        results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
    select(city_state, results) %>% 
    unnest(results) %>% 
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
    mutate(
        or = exp(estimate),
        lower95ci = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
        upper95ci = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error),
        city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, or)) %>% 
    select(city_state, or, lower95ci, upper95ci) 

all_cities_model
```

    ##  6 Boston, MA      0.674     0.356     1.28 
    ##  7 Buffalo, NY     0.521     0.290     0.935
    ##  8 Charlotte, NC   0.884     0.557     1.40

    ## 10 Cincinnati, OH  0.400     0.236     0.677
    ## # … with 37 more rows

### Plotting ORs and CI

``` r
model_plot <-
    all_cities_model %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = or)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower95ci, ymax = upper95ci), width = 0.2) +
      labs(
        title = "Homicides Esimates Across US Cities",
        x = "City",
        y = "Odds Ratio") + 
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 5, by = 0.5))
    

model_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_mff2137_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot shows that the odds of solving a homicide case of male victims
are lower compared to that of a female victim across most US cities with
the exception of Fresno, CA, stockton, CA, and Alberqueque, NM. The odds
are approximately similar in the cities of Minneapolis, MN, Oklahoma
City, OK, Tulsa, OK, Atlanta, GA, and Richmond, VA.

## Problem 2

### Data cleaning and tidying

``` r
birthweight <-
    read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>%
    mutate(
        babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
        babysex = factor(babysex),
        frace = recode(frace,
            "1" = "White",
            "2" = "Black",
            "3" = "Asian",
            "4" = "Puerto Rican",
            "8" = "Other",
            "9" = "Unknown"),
        frace = factor(frace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Unknown")),
        malform = recode(malform,"0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
        mrace = recode(mrace,
            "1" = "White",
            "2" = "Black",
            "3" = "Asian",
            "4" = "Puerto Rican",
            "8" = "Other"),
        mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other"))
    )
```

### Assessing missing values

``` r
apply(birthweight, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

``` r
n_missing <-
    birthweight %>% 
    skimr::skim() %>% select(n_missing) 
n_missing
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 × 1
    ##    n_missing
    ##        <int>
    ##  1         0
    ##  2         0
    ##  3         0

    ##  5         0
    ##  6         0

    ##  8         0
    ##  9         0
    ## 10         0
    ## 11         0
    ## 12         0
    ## 13         0
    ## 14         0
    ## 15         0

    ## 18         0
    ## 19         0
    ## 20         0

``` r
sum(is.na(birthweight))
```

    ## [1] 0

Using multiple methods, we conclude there are no missing values in the
`birthweight` dataset.

### Model building

Multiple studies found that gestational weight, somking, mother’s age
and income, baby’s gender, parity, and mother’s ethnicity were
significant predictors of low birthweight babies (Bailey et al. 2006,
Negi et al. 2006, Kelly et al. 2008, Mohammad et al. 2014). Based on
this literature review and what is generally known about race and income
as significant determinants of health, I will be including the baby’s
sex, family income, mother’s age and rave, parity, number of cigarettes
the mother smoked, and the mother’s weight gain during pregnancy in the
model. Birth weight `bwt` measured in grams is a continuous variable.
Thus, linear model would ne most appropriate to model it as an outcome
in a regression analysis.

``` r
bwt_fit <-
    lm(bwt ~ babysex + fincome + momage + mrace + parity + smoken + wtgain, data = birthweight) 

bwt_model_plot <-
    birthweight %>% 
    add_predictions(bwt_fit) %>% 
    add_residuals(bwt_fit) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
    geom_point()
```
